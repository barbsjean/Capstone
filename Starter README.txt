============================  THE QUESTIONS  ============================  


1.	How many games offer both keyboard and controller support? Are there different genres of games that seem to support more of one than the other?
2.	What are the top-rated games through the Steam library that have multiple supported languages? How many total players have played the games through the years and what were their platform availabilities? 


- other questions to consider with the new api stuff

* publishers and developers that had the most games with the most positive reviews... same with the negative reviews
	* the differences in between pos and neg, who had the biggest gap in between... who had about the same...
* most owners fall into the 0 .. 20,000 range, why? compare that to game play
* free-to-play games... are there any trends with free games and owners? avg playtime?

Some older games, one that have been played on Steam prior to March 2009, will be missing data since they didn't start recording gametime play until that time. [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/04/steam-gauge-addressing-your-questions-and-concerns/]
