# Steam Data Analysis

_My Capstone project for the Data Analytics Cohort #11 at Nashville Software School_

## I decided to do my Capstone on data I acquired from the pc-gaming platform, Steam.

### What exactly is Steam?

Steam was first launched in the Fall of 2003 by Valve Coroporation as a way to automatically provide game updates for its games at the time. By November of 2004, they released their first game for digital download. By 2005, they had multiple third-party developers releasing their games on Steam's playform. Now they are the definitve pc-gaming platform!

### How did I extract all this data?

I ran over 100 API calls to a partner website called SteamSpy to retrieve as much of the gaming collection as I could. I took those json files, converted them all to csv's, imported into Python, and away I went! 

From the data I pulled there was over 70,000 active games, a total of over 80,000 developers and publishers tied to those games, and over 125 reviews submitted by Steam players.
